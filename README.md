# Parallel Template Matching

This project implements Parallel Template Matching using Python and numba.
Template Matching is calculated using Normalized Cross Correlation.

## Usage

`python main.py -h`

`python main.py -i samples/01/source.png -t samples/01/template.png`

Output is a table containing comparison between this implementation and OpenCV implementation.

There are several sample images and templates in `samples/` directory.
